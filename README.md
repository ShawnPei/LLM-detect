# LLM-detect

In order to run this notebook, you have to change the file path to your own file path.  

I have already uploaded the original training dataset, but the external one is too big, if you want to download it, go to:
```https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thedrcat/daigt-proper-train-dataset/```  

Choose the train_drcat_04.csv file and it should do.
